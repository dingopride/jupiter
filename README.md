###### Requirements
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) *(**Note:** This script was developed to be used with the latest version of Python.)*

###### Information
This bot will automatically connect to a random EFNet server and idle in a channel.

The bot is designed to be very minimal, secure, and trustless by nature.

This means anyone can run a copy of your script on their server to help build your botnet.

All commands must be prefixed with @all or the bots nick and will work in PM or the configured channel.

Nicks added to the MONITOR list will attempt to jupe as the nick becomes available.
